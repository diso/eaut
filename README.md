Email Address to URL Transformation (EAUT) defines a mechanism for transforming the "addr-spec" portion of an RFC2822 email address into an associated URL. The transform options outlined in this document are designed to be flexible enough such that every DNS domain-owner can specify unlimited email address to URL transformations that services can easily discover and utilize in their URL-based transactions.
