![project status: inactive](https://img.shields.io/badge/project_status-inactive-red.svg?style=flat)This repository is an export of the previous Google Code project, and is provided here for historical purposes.  EAUT was replaced by [WebFinger](https://webfinger.net), which later became [RFC 7033](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7033).----Email Address to URL Transformation (EAUT) defines a mechanism for transforming the "addr-spec" portion of an RFC2822 email address into an associated URL. The transform options outlined in this document are designed to be flexible enough such that every DNS domain-owner can specify unlimited email address to URL transformations that services can easily discover and utilize in their URL-based transactions.
