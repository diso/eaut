				OpenID Email Address Transformation (OEAT) is an
				extension to the OpenID Authentication 2.0 protocol, and
				provides a straightforward mechanism to transform an
				RFC2822 email address into an OpenID-compatible URL or
				XRI. The transform options outlined in this document are
				designed to be flexible enough such that every DNS
				domain-owner can specify unlimited email address to
				OpenID transformations that Relying Parties can easily
				discover and utilize in their OpenID transactions.

		<section
			title='Reccommend Usage in OpenID Authentication 2.0'>
			<t>
				This protocol extension results in an OpenID Identifier
				that can be utilized by a Relying Party to initiate
				OpenID Authentication.

				<vspace blankLines="1" />
				Traditionally, OpenID Authentication 2.0 allows a
				User-Supplied Identifier to be an Identifier that is
				presented by the end user to the Relying Party, or
				selected by the user at the OpenID Provider. During the
				initiation phase of the OpenID 2.0 Authentication
				protocol, an end user may enter either their own
				Identifier or an OP Identifier. If an OP Identifier is
				used, the OP may then assist the end user in selecting
				an Identifier to share with the Relying Party.
				<vspace blankLines="1" />

				Using this extension, OpenID Relying parties can extend
				the definition of a User-Supplied Identifier to include
				an Email Identifier as follows:
				<vspace blankLines="1" />
				A User-Supplied Identifier is an OpenID Identifier or
				Email Identifier that was presented by the end user to
				the Relying Party, or an Identifier selected by the user
				at the OpenID Provider. During the initiation phase of
				the protocol, an end user may enter either their own
				Identifier, an OP Identifier, or an Email Identifier. If
				an OP Identifier is used, the OP may then assist the end
				user in selecting an Identifier to share with the
				Relying Party. If an Email Identifier is used, this
				identifier will be transformed into its corresponding
				OpenID URL or OpenID XRI, and used as a traditional
				User-Supplied Identifier in OpenID 2.0 Authentication.

			</t>

		</section>

		<section title="Normalization" anchor="normalization">
			<t>
				The Email Identifier provided to the Processing Agent
				MUST be normalized into a Normalized Email Identifier,
				as follows:
			</t>

			<t>
				<list style="numbers">
					<t>
						If the Email Identifier contains one or more
						comma's (ASCII #2C or ','), then all comma's in
						the Email Identifier SHALL be converted into
						semi-colon's (ASCII #3B or ';') using the ASCII
						character set.
						<vspace blankLines="1" />
					</t>
					<t>
						The resulting Email Identifier must be broken up
						into tokens using a semi-colon delmiter. The
						first token ONLY becomes the new Email
						Identifier for purposes of Normalization.
						<vspace blankLines="1" />
					</t>

					<t>
						If the resulting Email Identifier contains more
						than 1 'less-than' (ASCII #3C or '&lt;')
						character and/or more than one 'greater-than'
						(ASCII #3E or '&gt;') character, then the Email
						Identifier is considered to be invalid, and the
						transformation process SHOULD fail.
						<vspace blankLines="1" />

					</t>
					<t>
						If the resulting Email Identifier contains a
						single 'less-than' character, it SHOULD also
						contain a 'greater-than' character at some point
						after the 'less-than' character. If only one,
						but not both, of these character are present in
						the Email Identifier, then the Email Identifier
						is considered to be invalid, and the
						transformation process SHOULD fail.
						<vspace blankLines="1" />
					</t>

					<t>
						If a single 'less-than' character and a single
						'greater-than' character are both present in the
						Email Identifier, all text up to and including
						the 'less-than' character MUST be removed and
						discarded. In addition, all text from the
						'greater-than' character inclusive, to the end
						of the Email Identifier MUST be removed and
						discarded. For example, the Email Identifier
						'Beth "I'm cool" Jones"
						&lt;beth@example.com&gt;' MUST become
						'beth@example.com' (single quotes are for
						clarity, and not part of the actual protocol).
						<vspace blankLines="1" />
					</t>

					<t>
						Email Identifiers MUST then be further
						normalized to conform to section 3.4.1
						(Addr-spec specification) of RFC2822. After
						completing this Normalization process, the Email
						Identifier MUST be a valid Addr-spec as defined
						by RFC2822, and SHOULD be of the following form:
						addr-spec = local-part "@" domain
						<vspace blankLines="1" />
					</t>
					<t>
						After all normalization steps have been
						complete, the resulting ASCII string is known as
						the Normalized Email Identifier.
					</t>
				</list>

				See the
				<xref target="normalization_example">
					normalization examples

				for further valid and invalid examples of an Email
				Identifier that has been fully normalized.

		<section title="OEAT Discovery" anchor="discovery">

			<t>
				OEAT Discovery is the process by which a Processing
				Agent utilizes a Discovery Endpoint URL to look up
				("discover") the information necessary for transforming
				a Normalized Email Identifier into an OpenID Identifier
				(an OpenID URL or OpenID XRI). This extension protocol
				has only one path through which to do discovery:

			<t>
				<list style="numbers">

						information for the protocol to continue. If
						more than one applicable Service Element is
						returned in the XRDS-Simple document, the
						precedence rules defined in [XRI_Resolution_2.0]
						are to be applied.
					</t>
				</list>
			</t>

				valid XRDS-Simple document is retrieved, or no valid
				<xref target="valid_service_type_elements">
					Service Elements

				are found in the XRDS-Simple document), then discovery
				is considered to have failed for the supplied OEAT
				Discovery Endpoint URL.
			</t>

			<section title="Determining the OEAT Discovery Endpoint URL"
				anchor="obtaining-discovery-endpoint">
				<t>
					In order to obtain a Discovery Endpoint URL from a
					Normalized Email Address, the following process MUST
					be followed:
				</t>
				<t>
					<list style="numbers">
						<t>
							Parse the Normalized Email Address using the
							'at sign' ('@' ASCII #40) as a delimeter.

							be two tokens, the second of which will be
							the 'domain' of the Email Address as defined
							by RFC2822, section 3.4.1. (The first token
							will be the 'local-part' as defined by
							RFC2822). The first token SHOULD be
							discarded, leaving the second token, which
							is the 'domain'.
							<vspace blankLines="1" />
						</t>
						<t>
							Using the 'domain' result from the first
							step, prepend the string "http://" to it.
							<vspace blankLines="1" />

				anchor="ett_transform_procedure">
				<t>
					In order to transform a Normalized Email Address
					into an OpenID URL, Processing Agents may use a
					valid Email Address Tranform Template (ETT). If the
					valid ETT does not contain any Wildcard Replacement
					Fields, then the transform is complete: The ETT is
					the OpenID URL, and this transform extension
					protocol ends.
					<vspace blankLines="1" />
					However, if the ETT does contain a Wildcard
					Replacement Field, then the following procedure is
					used to transform the Normalized Email Address into
					an OpenID URL using an ETT:
				</t>

				<t>
					<list style="numbers">
						<t>
							Tokenize the Normalized Email Address using
							the 'at sign' ('@' ASCII #40) as a
							delimeter. The result of this parsing
							operation SHOULD be two tokens, the first of
							which will be the 'local-part' of the Email
							Address as defined by RFC2822, section
							3.4.1. (The second token will be the
							'domain).
							<vspace blankLines="1" />
						</t>
						<t>
							The ETT should be percent-decoded per
							section 2.1 of the URI specification.
							Specifically, %5B should be decoded to be
							the opening-bracket, while %5D should be
							decoded to be the closing bracket, but only
							where these two characters surround a valid
							Wildcard Replacement String (such as
							'username').
							<vspace blankLines="1" />
						</t>
						<t>
							Next, in the ETT replace the portion of the
							ETT that contains '[username]' (excluding
							single-quotes) with the value of the
							'local-part' portion of the email address.
							<vspace blankLines="1" />
						</t>
						<t>
							The resulting URI is a valid OpenID URL
							(Note that this URL will likely be treated
							as a Claimed Identifier, although this is
							ultimately OP-implementation defined).

			<t>
				In order to transform a Normalized Email Address into an
				OpenID Identifier, Processing Agents may utilize an
				Email-Address-to-OpenID (EATOID) Service. This section
				details how Processing Agents can access such service
				endpoints, and the expected results that MUST be
				returned.
			</t>

			<section title="EATOID Service Query"
				anchor="eatoid_service_query">
				<t>
					In order to query an EATOID Service, a Processing
					Agent SHOULD issue an HTTP GET request on the EATOID
					Service's Endpoint URL. The GET request must contain
					an attribute named 'email', with the Normalized
					Email Identifier as the value of this attribute. If
					more than one 'email' attribute is specified in the
					GET query, then EATOID Service Endpoints SHOULD
					utilize only the first attribute in the query
					string. See Appendix A.4 for a non-normative example
					of an EATOID Service Query.
				</t>
			</section>
			<section title="EATOID Service Result"
				anchor="eatoid_service_result">
				<t>
					After receiving an EATOID Service Query, an EATOID
					Service MUST return return an HTTP redirect (a 302)
					to an appropriately mapped OpenID URL.

		<section title='Security Considerations'>
			<section title="Man-in-the-Middle Attacks">
				<t>
					If DNS resolution or the transport layer is
					compromised, this protocol is not fully secure since
					the attacker can impersonate the OP and tamper with
					the discovery process. If an attacker can tamper
					with the discovery process he/she can specify any
					OP, and so does not have to impersonate the OP.
					Additionally, if an attacker can compromise the
					integrity of the information returned during the
					discovery process, by altering the XRDS document,
					the need for a man in the middle is removed. In such
					an attack, a forged OpenID Endpoint URL, forged ETT,
					or forged EATOID Endpoint URL could be returned. One
					method to prevent this sort of attack is by
					digitally signing the XRDS file as per
					<xref target="RFC3275">XMLDSIG</xref>
					. The keying material is not specified, since the RP
					ultimately needs to make its own decision whether to
					trust keys used for such a signature.
				</t>

				<t>
					Using SSL with certificates signed by a trusted
					authority prevents these kinds of attacks by
					verifying the results of the DNS look-up against the
					certificate. Once the validity of the certificate
					has been established, tampering is not possible.
					Impersonating an SSL server requires forging or
					stealing a certificate, which is significantly
					harder than the network based attacks.
				</t>

				<t>
					In order to get protection from SSL, SSL must be
					used for all parts of this protocol, While the
					protocol does not require SSL be used, its use is
					strongly RECOMMENDED. Current best practices dictate
					that an OP SHOULD use SSL, with a certificate signed
					by a trusted authority, to secure its Endpoint URL
					as well as the interactions with the Processing
					Agent. In addition, SSL, with a certificate signed
					by a trusted authority, SHOULD be used so that a
					Relying Party can fetch the end user's URL in a
					secure manner. Following its own security policies,
					a Processing-Agent MAY choose to not complete, or
					even begin, a transaction if SSL is not being
					correctly used at these various endpoints.
				</t>
			</section>
			<section title="EATOID Email-Address Harvesting Attack"
				anchor="eatoid_service_email_address_harvesting_attack">
				<t>
					EATOID Service Endpoints may be prone to an email
					address harvesting attack if the EATOID Service
					returns different HTTP codes for different email
					addresses. For example, if an EATOID service
					determines that a particular email address is not
					actually in use, and then returns a special result
					message to indicate this, an attacker could utilize
					this information in order to determine if a
					particular email address is valid or not for a
					particular domain.

					Thus, in order to reduce the risk of email address
					harvesting attacks, an EATOID Service should always
					redirect to a well-formed URL, even if the system is
					unable to verify that supplied email address
					actually corresponds to a valid OpenID Identifier.
					In this way, an attacker will not be able to
					determine if a particular email address is actually
					registered with the EATOID service.
				</t>
			</section>
			<section title="OP Email-Address Harvesting Attack"
				anchor="op_email_address_harvesting_attack">
				<t>
					OP's should be careful to always resolve a
					particular OpenID URL, even if that OpenID URL is
					not a valid OpenID in the OP system. If a particular
					OP does not resolve *all* OpenID Identifier URL's,
					then an email address harvesting attack could
					utilize an OEAT Service Endpoint to determine which
					email addresses correspond to valid OpenID
					Identifiers, thus increasing the value of harvested
					email addresses. This reccomendation holds true
					outside of this specification, although it is
					highlighted here because OEAT can exacerbate this
					problem by possibly connecting an email address to a
					particular OpenID Identifier URL.

						<t>
							OpenID Authentication provides a way to
							prove that an end user controls an
							Identifier. It does this without the Relying
							Party needing access to end user credentials
							such as a password or to other sensitive
							information such as an email address.
						</t>

						<t>
							OpenID is decentralized. No central
							authority must approve or register Relying
							Parties or OpenID Providers. An end user can
							freely choose which OpenID Provider to use,
							and can preserve their Identifier if they
							switch OpenID Providers.
						</t>

						<t>
							While nothing in the protocol requires
							JavaScript or modern browsers, the
							authentication scheme plays nicely with
							"AJAX"-style setups. This means an end user
							can prove their Identity to a Relying Party
							without having to leave their current Web
							page.
						</t>

						<t>
							OpenID Authentication uses only standard
							HTTP(S) requests and responses, so it does
							not require any special capabilities of the
							User-Agent or other client software. OpenID
							is not tied to the use of cookies or any
							other specific mechanism of Relying Party or
							OpenID Provider session management.
							Extensions to User-Agents can simplify the
							end user interaction, though are not
							required to utilize the protocol.
						</t>

						<t>
							The exchange of profile information, or the
							exchange of other information not covered in
							this specification, can be addressed through
							additional service types built on top of
							this protocol to create a framework. OpenID
							Authentication is designed to provide a base
							service to enable portable, user-centric
							digital identity in a free and decentralized
							manner.
